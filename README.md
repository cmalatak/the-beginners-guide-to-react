# The Beginner's Guide to React

### This is all the code I wrote while I worked through Kent C. Dodd's "The Beginner's Guide to React" online tutorial through Egghead.io

- **tbgtr7.html** is a couple clocks, that have to rerender every second to "tick".

- **tbgtr8.html** consists of a few boxes to work on styling react components with className and in line styles.

- **tbgtr9.html** is an Alien Tracker, which builds on the event handlers tutorial in this course.

- **tbgtr10.html** is a stopwatch, with the ability to start, stop, and clear.

- **tbgtr12.html** is a counter, that uses Class.

- **tbgtr13.html** is a really cool visual to practice manipulating the DOM with React refs.

- **tbgtr14.html** is a basic form built in react.

- **tbgtr15.html** builds on the form to make it more dynamic.
